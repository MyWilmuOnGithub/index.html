I    Hello, thankyoub for visiting my site. Currently I am a student
At Wilmington University. My expected graduation date is spring 
of 2024. I am making my way earning a BS degree in Computer Science.
 I will being focusing on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 
My plan is to use Machine Learning to find the missing pieces to future 
technologies involving what would be considered impossible feats or science 
fiction. Technologies like AI medical diagnosis and treatments using quantum,
 as well as nano resources to remove cure or eliminate illness disease and
 viruses. Before any of that is a possibility we will more than likely be 
Be Forced to face consequences for our use of the world's resources without
Regard to our actions. I know that will be a tough problem to work thru and I 
seriously have my doubts about us making it past that point. I say 
just like all the other worlds before us that failed as well. I say that because 
Of the simple fact, if any had survived it surely they would have contacted us by 
Now, showing up to give us the break we need as a for the most part peaceful world.
 
     Sorry  to throw my views on you like that, but it is who I am and about me. 
Whether, I have success at any if my plans and goals surely henges on us as whole 
succeeding
